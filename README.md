1. Text classification is the task of assigning a label to a text, such as spam or ham, news or fiction, or positive or negative sentiment.

2. Named entity recognition is the task of identifying and classifying named entities in text, such as people, places, organizations, and products.

3. Part-of-speech tagging is the task of assigning a part-of-speech tag to each word in a sentence, such as noun, verb, adjective, adverb, and preposition.
Chunking is the task of grouping words together into phrases or clauses.

4. Text summarization is the task of creating a shorter version of a text that retains the most important information.

5. Machine translation is the task of translating text from one language to another.

üëâüèª #Text preprocessing steps :

The following are the main text preprocessing steps:

1. Tokenization is the process of breaking a text into smaller units, called tokens. Tokens can be words, punctuation marks, or other characters.

2. Lowercasing is the process of converting all text to lowercase letters. This is done to ensure that all words are treated the same, regardless of their case.

3. Removal of stop words is the process of removing common words that do not add much meaning to the text, such as "the," "and," and "of."

4. Stemming or lemmatization are the processes of reducing words to their root form. This can help to improve the accuracy of NLP tasks, such as text classification and named entity recognition.

5. Spelling correction is the process of correcting spelling errors in text. This can help to improve the accuracy of NLP tasks, such as machine translation.

6. Normalization is the process of converting text to a standard format. This can help to improve the accuracy of NLP tasks, such as text classification and named entity recognition.

The specific text preprocessing steps that are performed will depend on the specific NLP task that is being performed. For example, text classification tasks typically only require tokenization, lowercasing, and removal of stop words. Named entity recognition tasks typically require tokenization, lowercasing, removal of stop words, stemming, and lemmatization.


üëâüèª **Procedure in NLP:**

1. Import necessary libraries like NLTK and SpaCy.
2. Load the dataset.
3. Text preprocessing including removing HTML tags, punctuation, stemming, stop words, and expanding contractions.
4. Tokenization to break sentences into words.
5. Stemming to reduce words to their base form.
6. Part-of-speech (POS) tagging to identify grammatical elements.
7. Lemmatization to transform words into their dictionary form.
8. Apply label encoding to convert labels into numerical values.
9. Feature extraction from the text.
10. Text to numerical vector conversion using techniques like BOW, TFIDF, Word2Vec, and GloVe.
11. Data preprocessing steps.
12. Model building.

**Terms in NLP:**
- Document: A row in the dataset.
- Corpus: Collection of all documents.
- Vocabulary: Unique words in the corpus.
- Segmentation: Breaking multiple sentences into individual sentences.
- Tokenization: Splitting sentences into words.
- StopWords: Commonly used words in a language.
- Stemming: Reducing words to their root form.
- Lemmatization: Converting words to their base form using a dictionary.
- NER Tagging: Adding tags to words for entities like names and places.
- POS Tagging: Labeling words with their parts of speech.
- Chunking: Converting sentences into flat trees.

**Text Pre-Processing Steps:**
Text preprocessing is essential in NLP to clean and prepare text data for analysis. Basic techniques include lowering case, removing punctuation, special characters, numbers, HTML tags, URLs, and extra spaces. Advanced techniques involve tokenization, stop word removal, stemming, and lemmatization. More advanced techniques include POS tagging and Named Entity Recognition (NER).
