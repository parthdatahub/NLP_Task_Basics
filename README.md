1. Text classification is the task of assigning a label to a text, such as spam or ham, news or fiction, or positive or negative sentiment.

2. Named entity recognition is the task of identifying and classifying named entities in text, such as people, places, organizations, and products.

3. Part-of-speech tagging is the task of assigning a part-of-speech tag to each word in a sentence, such as noun, verb, adjective, adverb, and preposition.
Chunking is the task of grouping words together into phrases or clauses.

4. Text summarization is the task of creating a shorter version of a text that retains the most important information.

5. Machine translation is the task of translating text from one language to another.

üëâüèª #Text preprocessing steps :

The following are the main text preprocessing steps:

1. Tokenization is the process of breaking a text into smaller units, called tokens. Tokens can be words, punctuation marks, or other characters.

2. Lowercasing is the process of converting all text to lowercase letters. This is done to ensure that all words are treated the same, regardless of their case.

3. Removal of stop words is the process of removing common words that do not add much meaning to the text, such as "the," "and," and "of."

4. Stemming or lemmatization are the processes of reducing words to their root form. This can help to improve the accuracy of NLP tasks, such as text classification and named entity recognition.

5. Spelling correction is the process of correcting spelling errors in text. This can help to improve the accuracy of NLP tasks, such as machine translation.

6. Normalization is the process of converting text to a standard format. This can help to improve the accuracy of NLP tasks, such as text classification and named entity recognition.

The specific text preprocessing steps that are performed will depend on the specific NLP task that is being performed. For example, text classification tasks typically only require tokenization, lowercasing, and removal of stop words. Named entity recognition tasks typically require tokenization, lowercasing, removal of stop words, stemming, and lemmatization.
